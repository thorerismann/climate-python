# climate-python

## About
Python & R course work for the UNIBE master in climate sciences. Each folder is one class.

In general the following packages are necessary, although some others may need to be imported. At a minimum, the following is required:
- seaborn (graphics)
- numpy
- pandas
- jupyter lab
- pip (to install specific modules as required)

__Check the rpy2 notebook for instructions on how to set up rpy2 - used sporadically to translate R into Python.
- rpy2 (to be installed with pip not conda)

## Classes included

### Climate and Agriculture
The Aquacrop OSPY package is used to run a randomization experiment on irrigation dates within a simple crop model framework.

Follow the instructions in the README.md file in the climate-agriculture folder to properly install the packages in the recomended order.

### Econometrics II

The R script used to generate the examples in the slides is reinterpreted using a mix of Python and the rpy2 packages.

### Weather and Climate Data

Pandas and seaborn is used to accomplish the weather and climate data module.

### Environmental Econometrics

R, Python, pyr2 used to accomplish the assignments and follow along with the coding in the course. Sphinx is developped to generate the .pdf homework files in a manner equivalent to latex. 

### Climate statistics. 

Weekly solutions provided in R and in Python / rpy2 (depending on time!)

### Miscellaneous

Other random stuff that comes up / empty for the moment

### Master

Kept in a separate repo.
